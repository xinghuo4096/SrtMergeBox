What is our nature?

744
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:24,568
Our nature is dark.

745
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:28,442
But I can teach you to starve it

746
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,184
so it doesn't consume you.

747
00:56:33,012 --> 00:56:35,971
But you said whatever
killed that deer back there,

748
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:37,190
that was in their nature.

749
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:40,236
You know why we're
called hellbenders?

750
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:43,022
Because we're powerful.

751
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:46,199
And anything powerful is feared.

752
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:51,770
Our ancestors grew drunk on
that fear, they craved it.

753
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:56,557
And so it was said we had
turned our backs on heaven

754
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,254
and bent towards hell.

755
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:03,477
Do you want that kind of legacy?

756
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:06,567
To be soulless?

757
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:08,395
Unloved?

758
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:10,745
Feared?

759
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:16,533
Pop quiz.

760
00:57:16,577 --> 00:57:20,886
What happens when you mix
huckleberries and tears?

761
00:57:24,237 --> 00:57:26,021
It enhances your eyesight.

762
00:57:26,065 --> 00:57:27,240
Okay, that's too easy.

763
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:32,245
What if you crush
spiderwebs and ivy.

764
00:57:34,464 --> 00:57:35,727
It makes your palms sticky

765
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,598
so you can climb
trees like squirrels.

766
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:39,556
Awesome.

767
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,340
It is.

768
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:43,212
Where'd you learn this stuff?

769
00:57:43,256 --> 00:57:43,996
My mother.

770
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:47,173
Anywhere else?

771
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:49,262
No.

772
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:54,571
Hey.

773
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:57,270
What do you know about ferns?

774
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:58,227
Nothing.

775
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,794
Oh, such a beautiful plant.

776
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:02,014
Self reproducing, like us.

777
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:04,233
Awesome.

778
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:05,147
It is.

779
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,323
And if you've crush ferns

780
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:13,634
and fungus with one other
very special element,

781
00:58:21,816 --> 00:58:23,339
you can smell blood on the wind.

782
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:27,822
Blood on the wind, I like that.

783
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:29,084
But I need you to understand

784
00:58:29,128 --> 00:58:31,913
we don't need this
kind of thing anymore.

785
00:58:31,957 --> 00:58:33,349
We're evolving.

786
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:35,917
Okay.

787
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:37,179
This is really fucking
cool, do you want to try it?

788
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,311

793

794
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:20,832

797

This is private property,
you're trespassing.

798
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:30,406
Actually, state land runs
right along these rocks.

799
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,017
That must be your property.

800
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:35,847
Can I talk to you for a minute?

801
00:59:37,457 --> 00:59:39,024

803

804
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:48,685
All right, since
we're short on time

805
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:50,905
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

806
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:53,560
Young lady, I need you to
be totally honest with me.

807
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,345
Where can I buy that shirt?

808
00:59:56,389 --> 00:59:57,869
[laughs] There's only one.

809
00:59:57,912 --> 00:59:59,871
I made it for our band.

811
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,439
All right, business.

812
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:06,007
I'm sure you all heard a
man was killed last summer

813
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:09,010
by a wild animal or wild animals

814
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:10,925
couple of miles from here.

815
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:13,536
It's my belief it's a
rabid mountain lion.

816
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,190
Have you guys noticed
any carcasses?

817
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:16,452
No.

818
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:17,366
This might have something to do

819
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,238
with the disappearance of a man.

820
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:23,198
We found his car on 209,
but no sign of his body.

821
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:24,721
You see many hikers around here?

822
01:00:24,765 --> 01:00:26,027
Nope.

823
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:27,550
Well, maybe it's a hellbender.

824
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:29,204
What's a hellbender?

825
01:00:29,248 --> 01:00:30,727
It's kind of a cross
between a witch,

826
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:33,426
a demon, and an apex predator.

827
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:35,907
They live off the fear that
pumps through human blood,

828
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,909
which gives them
exceptional power.

don't become a designer,

833
01:00:45,438 --> 01:00:46,918
you should become a writer.

plants its eggs there,

comes rebirth, maggots,

until they turn into flies.

01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,207
No.

927
01:07:48,556 --> 01:07:49,862
She was hanged.

928
01:07:52,386 --> 01:07:53,866
A waste of rope.

929
01:07:57,391 --> 01:07:59,872
So, then how'd she die?

930
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:04,224
The way all hellbenders die.

931
01:08:05,443 --> 01:08:08,184
Spring eats winter,
winter eats fall.

932
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:10,317
Fall eats summer.

933
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:17,063
How old are you?

934
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:23,939
147, I think.

935
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,378
How old are you going to be?

936
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:32,470
You tell me.

937
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,919
[wing howling softly]

938
01:08:46,962 --> 01:08:51,924
- [doorknob clicks]
- [keys rattle]

939
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:55,754
Hey.

940
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:57,756
[wind howling]

941
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,714
What are you doing here?

942
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:01,673
I just wanted to apologize.

943
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:06,721
How, how did you
know I work here?

944
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:09,158
[dog barking]

945
01:09:10,464 --> 01:09:12,118
You're stalking me.

946
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:13,946
- Fucking psycho.
- Hold on, hold on.

947
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,427
I just want to give you this.

948
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:20,300
What is it?

949
01:09:20,343 --> 01:09:21,301
It's your bikini.

950
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:24,260
Thanks.

951
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:25,958
Thanks for letting me borrow it.

952
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:28,656
No problem, hellbender.

953
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:32,573
Sorry for being such
a weirdo last summer.

954
01:09:32,617 --> 01:09:33,400
It's cool.

955
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:37,448
Can you believe what
happened to that guy?

956
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:39,450
What guy?

957
01:09:39,493 --> 01:09:41,190
The guy who chased us.

958
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:45,107
He got attacked by
some wild animal.

959
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:46,457
Oh.

960
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,675
That's crazy.

961
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:49,764
I was hoping nothing
happened to you,

962
01:09:49,808 --> 01:09:51,636
even though you were
being a nutcase.

963
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,160
Well, thanks for the bikini.

964
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:55,814
Oh, I almost forgot.

965
01:09:57,337 --> 01:09:58,469
I want to give you these.

966
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:02,211
Barrettes?

967
01:10:02,255 --> 01:10:04,126
They're yours.

968
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,127
I kind of stole them from you

969
01:10:05,171 --> 01:10:06,825
when I first met
you at the pool.

970
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:13,701
You know what,
back the fuck off!

971
01:10:13,745 --> 01:10:17,488
- [box rattling]
- [dog barking]

972
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:20,099
[wind howling]

973
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:34,113
[tense clanging music]

01:10:51,609 --> 01:10:54,873
[footsteps pattering]

975
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:55,874
Hey, Izzy!

976
01:10:59,138 --> 01:10:59,878
Iz?

977
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,059
[tense music]

978
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:22,901

- [air whooshing]
- [Izzy growling]

991
01:12:27,313 --> 01:12:28,314
Hey, Mom!

992
01:12:29,707 --> 01:12:32,840
You want to hear something
I wrote for Hellbender?

993
01:12:32,884 --> 01:12:33,841
[wind howling]

994
01:12:33,885 --> 01:12:34,668
Okay.

995
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,499
There was a wolf who
longed to be a sheep.

996
01:12:40,718 --> 01:12:44,112
So, she cut her claws
and cracked her teeth.

997
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:46,332
She buried deep
the wolf beneath.

998
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:51,076
And when she bore a cub,
she raised it as a lamb.

999
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:55,863
She cut its claws and
cracked its teeth.

1000
01:12:55,907 --> 01:12:58,170
She buried deep
the wolf beneath.

1001
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:02,957
But when the lamb
grew, so did her claws.

1002
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,829
So, did her teeth.

1003
01:13:04,872 --> 01:13:08,180
And the wolf ate her mother
who was just a sheep.

1004
01:13:09,268 --> 01:13:10,704
You like it?

1005
01:13:10,748 --> 01:13:13,359
[wind howling]

1006
01:13:14,534 --> 01:13:16,014
Hey, did you meet
my friend Amber?

1007
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:20,366
She's still alive and
she's scared shitless.

1008
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:21,193

I can't, I can't move.

Is she here?

01:16:37,955 --> 01:16:38,912
Please help.

Don't let her do this to me.

Please don't leave me.

[water dripping]

01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:23,739
Hey, Mom, that's
my friend Amber.

1065
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:27,047
Remember, we met her uncle
in the woods that day.

1066
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:28,962
I think you dusted him.

1067
01:17:29,963 --> 01:17:30,746
[air whooshing]

1068
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:34,054
Ooh, I like that trick.

1069
01:17:34,098 --> 01:17:35,838
It's a great one to do
right in front of people.

1070
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:40,060
It just fuckin' paralyzes
them with fear, like Amber.

1071
01:17:40,104 --> 01:17:42,280
I saw you take a taste.

1072
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:43,455
- No.
- Izzy...

1073
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:47,459
What, what have you done, what?

1074
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:50,201
What is this place?

1075
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:52,203
My happy place.

1076
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:55,510
I'm not gonna let
you kill this girl.

1077
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:59,819
I'm gonna save her
so I can save you.

1078
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:02,256
[chuckles] Save me from what?

1079
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,432
[amber groaning]

1080
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:08,088
Izzy, I just wanted to save you

1081
01:18:08,132 --> 01:18:10,438
from the hell that I've known.

1082
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:13,789
I just wanted us to be...

1083
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,356
AMBER: Please!

1084
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,662
People.

1085
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:18,185
People?

1086
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:20,231
Like the people
you've kept me from?

1087
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:22,146
Like Amber?

1088
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:26,324
The people that believe
in good and evil?

1089
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:28,717
God and the devil?

1090
01:18:32,025 --> 01:18:33,984
If they want to believe
in hell so badly,

1091
01:18:35,028 --> 01:18:36,116
I'll give 'em hell.

1092
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,857
AMBER: Let me go!

1093
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:38,858
Izzy, you're good.

1094
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:42,383
I raised you to be good.

1095
01:18:44,037 --> 01:18:44,864
Not evil.

1096
01:18:47,867 --> 01:18:50,000
I saw the book.

1097
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:55,005
The blood, the bodies,
the babies, the terror.

1098
01:18:56,528 --> 01:18:59,705
I listened to your secrets
and I watched your dreams.

1099
01:19:01,185 --> 01:19:02,273
I know the truth, Mom.

1100
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:07,147
I did what I was taught to do.

1101
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,757
And you denied me that right.

1102
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:11,543
[scoffs] Right.

1103
01:19:12,718 --> 01:19:16,635
To be a tool for the
hands of hell. [laughs]

1104
01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:19,638
It's not a gift, Izzy.

1105
01:19:20,813 --> 01:19:22,554
Then why was it given?

1106
01:19:22,597 --> 01:19:24,077
[water dripping]

1107
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:26,645
I know the only way
a hellbender can die.

1108
01:19:27,907 --> 01:19:30,910
Winter eats fall,
fall eats summer,

1109
01:19:32,085 --> 01:19:35,393
summer eats spring,
and spring eats winter.

1110
01:19:36,829 --> 01:19:40,398
Did your mother
sacrifice herself or?

1111
01:19:41,921 --> 01:19:42,748
I think I know.

1112
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,577
Watch out, Mom.

1113
01:19:47,231 --> 01:19:49,059
You might turn into
a real hellbender.

1114
01:19:49,102 --> 01:19:50,930
[Mother groaning]

1115
01:19:50,973 --> 01:19:52,540
I know you're in there.

1116
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,064
Show me.

1117
01:19:54,107 --> 01:19:56,849
[Mother groaning]

1118
01:19:59,243 --> 01:20:00,070
Let me see.

1119
01:20:00,113 --> 01:20:02,898
[Mother growling]

1120
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:03,943
There you are.

1121
01:20:05,771 --> 01:20:06,772
You're so beautiful.

1122
01:20:09,688 --> 01:20:10,471
Thank you.

1123
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,996
Now, it's my turn.

1124
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,042
I'm not afraid of you, Izzy.

1125
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:18,262
You will be.

1126
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:25,269
- [flames whooshing]
- [Mother groaning]

1127
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:30,230
[Mother whimpering]

1128
01:20:30,274 --> 01:20:34,408
Help, please help me. [whimpers]

1129
01:20:34,452 --> 01:20:35,583
- [Amber screams]
- [head crumbles]

1130
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:38,282
[Izzy roars]

1131
01:20:38,325 --> 01:20:40,980
[ominous music]

1132
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:45,115
[water dripping]

1133
01:20:50,903 --> 01:20:53,123
Don't, I'm not ready.

1134
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:54,776
I'm not ready.

1135
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,864
I'm not ready.

1136
01:20:55,908 --> 01:20:57,127
I'm not, don't.

1137
01:20:58,824 --> 01:21:01,696
Mom, I'm not gonna eat you.

1138
01:21:03,307 --> 01:21:05,309
I'm not ready to have
a little hellbender.

1139
01:21:07,485 --> 01:21:08,660
And I love you.

1140
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:13,491
I'm going to town,
you need anything?

1141
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:17,147
MOTHER: Bass strings.

1142
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,017
You got it.

1143
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:23,196
[eerie clanging music]

1144
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,285
- [thunder cracking]
- [Izzy screaming]

1145
01:21:25,329 --> 01:21:28,158
[hard rock music]
