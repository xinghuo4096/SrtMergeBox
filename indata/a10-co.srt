00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:57,055
You haven't changed a day.

00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,449
You were my grandmother's nurse.

00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:01,756
I'm sorry, I think
you're mistaken.

46
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:04,236
That'll be $75.

47
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,063
Thanks.

00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:05,890
Thank you.

You have a great day.

00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:08,023
Bye!

51
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:33,788
Hey, Mom.

52
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,832
Hey, kiddo.

53
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:35,920
How was town?

54
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,617
Same old, same old.

55
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,315
Got some fun shit though.

56
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:42,274
Check this out.

57
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:43,275
Oh!

58
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,929
New look for the band maybe?

59
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:45,974
I love it, man.

60
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,149
That is sick!

61
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,151
It's so cool.

62
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:50,979
What else?

63
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,416
I went to the record shop.

64
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:55,157
Thought these looked cool.

65
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,723
That's awesome.

66
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,291
I can't wait to
look through them.

67
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,122
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

68
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,515
I like making you happy.

69
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,952
How about you?

70
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:08,823
How was your day?

71
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:11,521
It was good.

72
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:14,524
I went hunting.

73
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:16,265
For what?

74
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,006
A laugh.

75
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:21,574
But

76
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:23,141
it was a ghost.

77
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,098
Great food in
the in the forest today.

78
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,577
It looks good.

79
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,753
Spring eats
winter, winter eats fall.

80
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:56,234
Fall eats summer,
summer eats spring.

81
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,107
Oh!

82
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,717
Hi!

83
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,588
Oh my God.

84
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,373
Sorry, sorry to bother you.

85
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:18,768
Woo, I am so lost!

86
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,944
You're, you're trespassing.

87
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,076
Understood.

88
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,209
Oh my God, I've been
hiking for hours.

89
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:29,083
I, I parked on 209,

90
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,476
and now I just can't
find my way back.

91
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,218
Do you know where 209 is?

92
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,090
Is this your property?

93
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,483
Yeah, I live here with my mom.

94
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,616
You're a country
girl, like my niece.

95
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:41,573
Amber Hanson?

96
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:42,966
She goes to school in town.

97
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:45,621
I'm homeschool.

98
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:46,883
Oh.

99
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,321
Anyway, she lives like
one mountain over,

100
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,455
or one mountain over.

101
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:57,415
She lives a mountain
over.

102
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,851
I gotta show you something.

103
00:13:58,895 --> 00:13:59,722
Look at this.

104
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,116
Those don't work out here.

105
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,683
If they did work, I
wouldn't be so lost.

106
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:09,645
I took a picture of something
that was just super odd.

107
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,690
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

108
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,605
I'm sick.

109
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,781
Oh, you don't look sick.

110
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,653
- I am.
- Well, look at this.

111
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,786
Hey!

112
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,885
Pleased to meet you.

113
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,685
Oh, fucking god!

114
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:56,431
How the fuck?

115
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:05,657
So, is that your
daughter that I met?

116
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,533
What's wrong with her?

117
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:16,755
Do you know the Hansons?

118
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,105
I was telling your
daughter that my niece

119
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,020
lives fairly close.

120
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:25,199
I was thinking that maybe
I could introduce them.

121
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:26,374
I think they'd really

122
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,376
get along.

123
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,508
Are you married?

124
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:32,902
No.

125
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:36,210
Do you have any children?

126
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:37,428
No.

127
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:39,561
I would have liked
to have kids though.

128
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:44,261
Okay.

129
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:03,471
I didn't get too
close to him, I promise.

130
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:05,211
Okay.

131
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,476
You think I'm gonna be okay?

132
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,611
You'll be fine.

133
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,798
Hey!

134
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:23,540
I see you, you big perve!

135
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,410
AJ!

136
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,676
I'm gonna fuck you up!

137
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,506
Oh!

138
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:33,376
You're not AJ.

139
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,857
Sorry.

140
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm Izzy.

141
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,819
Amber.

142
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,429
I'm your neighbor.

143
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:45,649
I live up on that mountain.

144
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:46,520
Which mountain?

145
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,045
That mountain.

146
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:52,700
Well, that's news to me.

147
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,049
You want a beer, neighbor?

148
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,361
Well, are you gonna be creepy
or are you gonna come over?

149
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:28,431
Are you gonna sit the
fuck down or what?

150
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:32,957
I'm sick.

151
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,263
What do you got, an STD?

152
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,309
I'm just fuckin' with ya.

153
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:39,703
Sit.

154
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,706
I can't get close to people.

155
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,533
None of us can.

156
00:21:46,536 --> 00:21:48,059
I'll sit.

157
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,818
How come I've never
seen you before?

158
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,603
I'm homeschooled.

159
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:11,300
Well, what do you do for fun?

160
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,477
I hike.

161
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:17,611
I draw.

162
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:19,874
And swim, I swim.

163
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,529
I'm in a band.

164
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,662
Well, that's cool,
what do you play?

165
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:26,924
The drums.

166
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:28,360
Oh, cool, I used
to date a drummer.

167
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:31,102
They're hot, but dumb.

168
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,756
I sing, too.

169
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,670
Nice.

170
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,455
And I write the lyrics also.

171
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:38,457
Damn, girl, what's
your band's name?

172
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,284
Hellbender.

173
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,635
Wicked.

174
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:42,984
You should come play at
a part of mine sometime.

175
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,768
That'd be so cool!

176
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,128
Drink up.

177
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:58,521
But don't piss in the pool.

178
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:45,149
Liar!

179
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:56,378
Mom.

180
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,120

What?

199
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:24,858
This isn't your home?

200
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,772
You thought
I lived here?

201
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:27,991
No fuckin' way.

202
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:29,558
I just sneak in
to use their pool.

203
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,516
Somebody's got to use it.

204
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,388
They're city-ots,
they'll never know.

205
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,173
Well, where do you live?

206
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:37,609
About a mile down the road.

207
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:38,784
It's not as nice.

208
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:51,928
I've got some friends coming
tomorrow, you should come.

209
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:53,103
Okay.

210
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,192
Bring a bathing
suit this time.

211
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,586
I don't have a bathing suit.

212
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,502
I'll bring you one.

213
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:02,460
You look like a cross between
Kurt Cobain and a wet dog.

214
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,419
Okay.

215
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:07,291
See you tomorrow, Hellbender!

216
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,902
See ya, Amber.

217
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,924
I want to play out.

218
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:31,837
What?

219
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:33,709
I want to play out, for people.

220
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:37,408
That's not gonna happen.

221
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:38,714
Why not?

222
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,412
I mean, we do all this
and we're really good.

223
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:42,936
I think that we
should show people.

224
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,503
Well, you know, we do it for us.

225
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,070
It's our thing.

226
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:49,116
'Cause it's fun.

227
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,772
I love playing with you,
but I think it'd be fun

228
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:58,734
to share our fucking amazing
songs with other people.

229
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:01,084
I think people would
really like them.

230
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:02,433
If a band plays in the woods

231
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:03,826
and there's no one
there to hear it,

232
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:05,349
did the band really play?

233
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,788
Izzy, what's going on?

234
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,138
Nothing, I'm just.

235
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,357
What if I'm better?

236
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,663
You're not.

237
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:16,795
You took me away from
people when I was five.

238
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,101
How do you know?

239
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:20,886
I know that I don't want
to take any chances.

240
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,106
I love you too much.

241
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,412
I love you, too.

242
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:28,633
But I also love the idea
of meeting other people

243
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:31,636
who might like music as
much as me, or something.

244
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,898
You know?

245
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:34,683
Maybe I could just
have one friend.

246
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:35,989
All I need is one.

247
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:39,166
Izzy, you can't be
around anyone, ever.

248
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:43,518
Let's just practice.

249
00:28:45,085 --> 00:28:46,086
Armageddon?

250
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:48,001
Okay.

00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:52,309

All right, Hellbender.

265
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,144
I got you something
on the chair.

AJ's going to med
school in the fall.

270
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,594
You should tell
him about your STD.

271
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:44,856
I don't have an STD.

272
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,423
I have an immune disease.

273
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,946
Oh, which one?

274
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,602
X-linked severe combined
immunodeficiency disease.

275
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:52,690
That's weird.

276
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,344
I thought only boys got that,

277
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,868
and it's super fatal
passed infancy.

278
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:59,044
Well, if that's true you
can thank your mom for it.

279
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,176

In celebration of our new friend
and her first tequila shot,

292
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,847
I will place in one of these
cups not the typical dead worm

293
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:04,632
you'd find at the
bottom of a bottle,

294
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:10,464
but a real, live, bloody
bodacious earthworm.

295
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:34,009

296
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:39,144

You were vegetarian.

298
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:42,060
Now, you're a worm-atarian.

299
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:43,975
Oh, come on guys,
leave her alone.

300
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:44,889
I'll have the worm.

301
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,239
No, them's the rules.

302
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:48,458
You get the worm,
you eat the worm.

303
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:49,633
Come on, kid.

304
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,244
It'll give you
superhuman strength.

305
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:53,333
Hold your nose, you
won't even taste it.

306
00:33:48,475 --> 00:33:49,693
Hey!

307
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,151
Oh my God.

308
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:18,200
They never come up
on weekdays!

309
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,333
Dude, you forgot your clothes.

310
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:24,337
And your fucking shoes.

311
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,468
You wild woman!

312
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:28,819
I'm gonna need that bikini back.

313
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:32,432
Oh my God, you're
so fucking screwed.

314
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,053
Dude, I'm not gay.

315
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,707
But I got friends
you could meet.

316
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:03,463
What the fuck, dude?

317
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:09,425
Don't you ever fucking
come near me again!

318
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,346
Hey, you're fucked!

319
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,087
I'm sick of you kids
trashing my pool

320
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:04,828
and breaking into my pool house!

321
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,787
That is a vintage drum set!

322
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:09,616
Look at me when I'm
fucking talking to you!

323
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:12,923
Are you stoned?

324
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,099
Are you fucking high?

325
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:15,970
Hello?

326
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:19,147
Fucking pathetic.

327
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:21,584
You're an idiot.

328
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:23,020
You're coming with me
and I'm calling the cops.

329
00:36:51,658 --> 00:36:53,442
Where have you been?

330
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,837
I was with some friends.

331
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:10,677
I ate a worm.

332
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:14,855
A live worm.

333
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,119
Are your friends okay?

334
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:22,297
They'll be fine.

335
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:28,956
I'm not sick.

336
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,221
You're dangerous.

337
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:41,534
My friend Amber's uncle's
been missing for two days.

338
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:51,761
Izzy.

339
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,244
It's gonna be okay.

340
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:58,986
I'm gonna help you.

341
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:04,731
Can we talk about
what happened today?

342
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,420
Hey!

343
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,117
You're not gonna
eat that, are you?

344
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,424
No.

345
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,731
'Cause the hairs kind of
get stuck in your teeth.

346
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:04,040
Why did that
worm make me so crazy?

347
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:05,476
It wasn't the worm.

348
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,391
It was the life in the worm.

349
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:11,047
Magic comes from the
fear, the fear of death.

350
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:12,875
Every living thing has it.

351
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:16,270
The more fear pumping through
the blood, the more power.

352
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:19,447
You think the worm
gives you power?

353
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:22,624
Try a rat.

354
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:24,757
Or a dog, woo!

355
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,540
Or a deer.

356
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:29,805
It's all in the pumping blood.

357
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,770
What happens if we eat...

358
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:41,338
What?

359
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:43,471
People.

360
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:48,128
Then you'll know power.

361
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,129
Is this a dream?

362
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:44,140
Wow.

363
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,534
I have never seen you like
raspberry thorn so much.

364
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:48,884
Your tastes are maturing.

365
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:52,627
I shouldn't have said anything.

366
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,065
Will you take a
rainy hike with me?

367
00:42:57,588 --> 00:42:58,372
Sure.

368
00:43:10,906 --> 00:43:12,734
I shouldn't have
kept this from you.

369
00:43:13,953 --> 00:43:15,128
It was a mistake.

370
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,391
It's all right.

371
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:19,872
Why did you?

372
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,876
Keep you safe.

373
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:24,659
From what?

374
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,228
You've opened a door that

375
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:33,450
once it's open, it
can be hard to shut.

376
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:36,714
But you only opened
it a little, right?

377
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:38,368
So, that's good.

378
00:43:38,412 --> 00:43:39,152
In fact, it's.

379
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:41,632
It's great.

380
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:45,549
It was bound to be open
and I wish I was there.

381
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:47,377
I should've been there.

382
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:49,031
You're good, Izzy.

383
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:50,380
You're good.

384
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:52,861
I can help you keep
it all in control.

385
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:07,920
So, we're the same?

386
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,097
Yeah.

387
00:44:12,707 --> 00:44:14,100
Was your mom like us?

388
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:17,625
Well.

389
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:20,933
She was, but she
wasn't a good mother.

390
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:25,111
And in the end, she might've
wished she had been.

391
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:32,335
So, can we leave
the mountain now?

392
00:44:33,293 --> 00:44:34,120
No.

393
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:36,731
Why, I'm not sick.

394
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:40,604
Look, I'm gonna
show you something,

395
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:42,824
but you gotta promise
no more door slammin'.

396
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:44,652
Okay?

397
00:44:51,746 --> 00:44:54,270
Eat it quick while
it's still alive.

398
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,386
All right, show me
what you got, kid.

399
00:46:37,112 --> 00:46:38,592
Holy shit.

400
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:43,553
And that's why you can't
leave the mountain.

401
00:47:07,142 --> 00:47:11,973
♪ Yeah, I'm a mother
fuckin' mountain ♪

402
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:17,283

411
00:49:37,814 --> 00:49:39,076
Hey.

412
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,077
Hey.

413
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:41,775
What are you doing down there?

414
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:45,953
I was just putting
back some paint.

415
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,640
I can hear you hearing me!

416
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:06,207
Hey.

417
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,034
Can I come in?

418
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:09,166
Sure.

419
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:18,698
You remember the friend you,
uh, you made last summer?

420
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:20,830
Amber?

421
00:51:20,874 --> 00:51:21,701
Yeah.

422
00:51:23,616 --> 00:51:24,530
You still friends?

423
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:29,883
Do you ever see her?

424
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:32,799
No.

425
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:39,196
Is that because I'd
forbidden you to

426
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,547
or did something bad happen?

427
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:45,638
The last time I saw her,

428
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:50,077
she said that my friendship
was kind of suffocating her.

429
00:51:52,906 --> 00:51:54,081
That's not your fault.

430
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,172
But remember, Iz,
we're not like them.

431
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,567
We don't need them.

432
00:52:03,612 --> 00:52:05,919
We can be perfectly
happy here, together.

433
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:09,009
Alone.

434
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,101
How come I'm the only one
who's completely alone then?

435
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,540
Well, we can work on that.

436
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:19,889
When...

437
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:21,543
When I'm not dangerous?

438
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:22,370
Yeah.

439
00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:25,504
Dangerous to who?

440
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:28,942
Whom?

441
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:41,607
Hey, Iz, I'm going to
town, do you need anything?

442
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,999
No, thank you.

443
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:43,826
Have fun.

444
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,927
Hey, let's go to the ravine.

445
00:55:09,276 --> 00:55:09,972
Okay.

446
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:12,888
Mom.

447
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:13,715
Mom.

448
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:14,586
Oh.

449
00:55:17,937 --> 00:55:18,677
More bones.

450
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:26,902
What do you think did this?

451
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:28,904
I don't know.

452
00:55:28,948 --> 00:55:31,341
I've been seeing a
lot of bones lately.

453
00:55:31,385 --> 00:55:33,953
All stripped clean, like this.

454
00:55:33,996 --> 00:55:35,084
Impressive.

455
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:39,480
Probably coyotes.

456
00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:41,569
Beautiful.

457
00:55:44,572 --> 00:55:45,312
But vicious.

458
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:46,618
No, no, I.

459
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:49,316
Whatever did this, it's
neither right or wrong.

460
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,491
It's just their nature.

461
00:56:18,737 --> 00:56:20,521
What is our nature?

462
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:24,568
Our nature is dark.

463
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:28,442
But I can teach you to starve it

464
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,184
so it doesn't consume you.

465
00:56:33,012 --> 00:56:35,971
But you said whatever
killed that deer back there,

466
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:37,190
that was in their nature.

467
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:40,236
You know why we're
called hellbenders?

468
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:43,022
Because we're powerful.

469
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:46,199
And anything powerful is feared.

470
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:51,770
Our ancestors grew drunk on
that fear, they craved it.

471
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:56,557
And so it was said we had
turned our backs on heaven

472
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,254
and bent towards hell.

473
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:03,477
Do you want that kind of legacy?

474
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:06,567
To be soulless?

475
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:08,395
Unloved?

476
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:10,745
Feared?

477
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:16,533
Pop quiz.

478
00:57:16,577 --> 00:57:20,886
What happens when you mix
huckleberries and tears?

479
00:57:24,237 --> 00:57:26,021
It enhances your eyesight.

480
00:57:26,065 --> 00:57:27,240
Okay, that's too easy.

481
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:32,245
What if you crush
spiderwebs and ivy.

482
00:57:34,464 --> 00:57:35,727
It makes your palms sticky

483
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,598
so you can climb
trees like squirrels.

484
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:39,556
Awesome.

485
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,340
It is.

486
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:43,212
Where'd you learn this stuff?

487
00:57:43,256 --> 00:57:43,996
My mother.

488
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:47,173
Anywhere else?

489
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:49,262
No.

490
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:54,571
Hey.

491
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:57,270
What do you know about ferns?

492
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:58,227
Nothing.

493
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,794
Oh, such a beautiful plant.

494
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:02,014
Self reproducing, like us.

495
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:04,233
Awesome.

496
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:05,147
It is.

497
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,323
And if you've crush ferns

498
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:13,634
and fungus with one other
very special element,

499
00:58:21,816 --> 00:58:23,339
you can smell blood on the wind.

500
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:27,822
Blood on the wind, I like that.

501
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:29,084
But I need you to understand

502
00:58:29,128 --> 00:58:31,913
we don't need this
kind of thing anymore.

503
00:58:31,957 --> 00:58:33,349
We're evolving.

504
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:35,917
Okay.

505
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:37,179
This is really fucking
cool, do you want to try it?

506
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,311
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

507
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:01,682
What do you smell?

508
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,164
A crow?

509
00:59:11,387 --> 00:59:12,171
A rabbit?

510
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:18,177
I smell something big.

511
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:20,832
Good.

512
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:21,745
I smell a man.

513
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:22,703
Hello!

514
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:26,489
This is private property,
you're trespassing.

515
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:30,406
Actually, state land runs
right along these rocks.

516
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,017
That must be your property.

517
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:35,847
Can I talk to you for a minute?

518
00:59:37,457 --> 00:59:39,024
How about 30 seconds?

519
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,503
We're just leaving.

520
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:42,201
10 seconds, I'm a fast talker.

521
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:48,685
All right, since
we're short on time

522
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:50,905
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

523
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:53,560
Young lady, I need you to
be totally honest with me.

524
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,345
Where can I buy that shirt?

525
00:59:56,389 --> 00:59:57,869
There's only one.

526
00:59:57,912 --> 00:59:59,871
I made it for our band.

527
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:01,176
10 seconds.

528
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,439
All right, business.

529
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:06,007
I'm sure you all heard a
man was killed last summer

530
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:09,010
by a wild animal or wild animals

531
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:10,925
couple of miles from here.

532
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:13,536
It's my belief it's a
rabid mountain lion.

533
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,190
Have you guys noticed
any carcasses?

534
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:16,452
No.

535
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:17,366
This might have something to do

536
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,238
with the disappearance of a man.

537
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:23,198
We found his car on 209,
but no sign of his body.

538
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:24,721
You see many hikers around here?

539
01:00:24,765 --> 01:00:26,027
Nope.

540
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:27,550
Well, maybe it's a hellbender.

541
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:29,204
What's a hellbender?

542
01:00:29,248 --> 01:00:30,727
It's kind of a cross
between a witch,

543
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:33,426
a demon, and an apex predator.

544
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:35,907
They live off the fear that
pumps through human blood,

545
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,909
which gives them
exceptional power.

546
01:00:39,214 --> 01:00:40,389
They've been around
since the dawn of time,

547
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,043
and they're still evolving.

548
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:45,394
Young lady, if you
don't become a designer,

549
01:00:45,438 --> 01:00:46,918
you should become a writer.

550
01:00:46,961 --> 01:00:48,789
All right, deal?

551
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:50,922
All right, ladies.

552
01:00:50,965 --> 01:00:52,097
Take care of
yourselves out there.

553
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,489
Have a good one.

554
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:32,762
A worm?

555
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:36,984
You want to go back
to moss and twigs?

556
01:02:38,725 --> 01:02:40,205
I mean, it's baby food.

557
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:44,905
Why don't we eat a frog?

558
01:02:46,602 --> 01:02:47,603
Or a hedgehog?

559
01:02:49,214 --> 01:02:52,739
Or we can just go out
for burgers.

560
01:02:58,919 --> 01:02:59,659
Help mine.

561
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:11,845

562
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,245

I'll devour you.

572
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:28,443
Hey, Izzy, I know you're pissed.

573
01:04:28,487 --> 01:04:29,836
Let's smoke a peace pipe.

574
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:36,451
This is my special stash.

575
01:04:38,888 --> 01:04:39,759
Maggots?

576
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:42,283
They're so small.

577
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:44,024
But potent.

578
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:47,810
They can't be that
frightful though.

579
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:50,987
Oh, they are the great
death feeders of the world.

580
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:53,468
Think about the
lifecycle of a fly.

581
01:04:53,512 --> 01:04:56,993
A fly feeds on death,
plants its eggs there,

582
01:04:57,037 --> 01:05:00,997
and then within that death
comes rebirth, maggots,

583
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:03,826
which then feed on death
until they turn into flies.

584
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:07,656
Then the whole cycle
starts over again.

585
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,049
How magic is that?

586
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,486
And these babies were chowing

587
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,227
on one of the deer I
found in the forest,

588
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:16,491
which looked like it came
to a pretty terrifying end.

589
01:05:16,535 --> 01:05:19,059
Trust me, there is
plenty to get ripped on.

590
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:23,237
Try one.

591
01:05:37,425 --> 01:05:39,079
Let's fly.

592
01:05:39,122 --> 01:05:40,602
Come on, let's fly!

593
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:43,257
It takes a lot more
than maggots to fly,

594
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:44,519
you greedy cunt!

595
01:05:44,563 --> 01:05:47,783
Then you can have
your useless maggots!

596
01:06:09,152 --> 01:06:09,936
Oh my god!

597
01:06:29,608 --> 01:06:30,435
Bitch.

598
01:06:36,441 --> 01:06:38,007
Have you been in my dreams?

599
01:06:39,008 --> 01:06:40,445
We would make a great team.

600
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,801
Oh, I don't feel so good.

601
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:53,501
I need a shower.

602
01:06:59,159 --> 01:06:59,986
That was fun.

603
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:05,818
Yeah, but we
cannot do that again.

604
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:08,081
That was very, very bad.

605
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:14,914
Tell me about your mom.

606
01:07:18,004 --> 01:07:19,484
She was a monster.

607
01:07:23,401 --> 01:07:25,185
She ate half a village.

608
01:07:27,405 --> 01:07:28,319
They were children.

609
01:07:31,017 --> 01:07:32,018
My friends.

610
01:07:36,544 --> 01:07:40,418
She felt so guilty, she
sewed her mouth shut.

611
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:44,422
Did she starve to death?

612
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,207
No.

613
01:07:48,556 --> 01:07:49,862
She was hanged.

614
01:07:52,386 --> 01:07:53,866
A waste of rope.

615
01:07:57,391 --> 01:07:59,872
So, then how'd she die?

616
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:04,224
The way all hellbenders die.

617
01:08:05,443 --> 01:08:08,184
Spring eats winter,
winter eats fall.

618
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:10,317
Fall eats summer.

619
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:17,063
How old are you?

620
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:23,939
147, I think.

621
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,378
How old are you going to be?

622
01:08:31,338 --> 01:08:32,470
You tell me.

623
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:55,754
Hey.

624
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,714
What are you doing here?

625
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:01,673
I just wanted to apologize.

626
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:06,721
How, how did you
know I work here?

627
01:09:10,464 --> 01:09:12,118
You're stalking me.

628
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:13,946
- Fucking psycho.
- Hold on, hold on.

629
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,427
I just want to give you this.

630
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:20,300
What is it?

631
01:09:20,343 --> 01:09:21,301
It's your bikini.

632
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:24,260
Thanks.

633
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:25,958
Thanks for letting me borrow it.

634
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:28,656
No problem, hellbender.

635
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:32,573
Sorry for being such
a weirdo last summer.

636
01:09:32,617 --> 01:09:33,400
It's cool.

637
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:37,448
Can you believe what
happened to that guy?

638
01:09:38,492 --> 01:09:39,450
What guy?

639
01:09:39,493 --> 01:09:41,190
The guy who chased us.

640
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:45,107
He got attacked by
some wild animal.

641
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:46,457
Oh.

642
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,675
That's crazy.

643
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:49,764
I was hoping nothing
happened to you,

644
01:09:49,808 --> 01:09:51,636
even though you were
being a nutcase.

645
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,160
Well, thanks for the bikini.

646
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:55,814
Oh, I almost forgot.

647
01:09:57,337 --> 01:09:58,469
I want to give you these.

648
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:02,211
Barrettes?

649
01:10:02,255 --> 01:10:04,126
They're yours.

650
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,127
I kind of stole them from you

651
01:10:05,171 --> 01:10:06,825
when I first met
you at the pool.

652
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:13,701
You know what,
back the fuck off!

653
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:55,874
Hey, Izzy!

654
01:10:59,138 --> 01:10:59,878
Iz?

655
01:12:27,313 --> 01:12:28,314
Hey, Mom!

656
01:12:29,707 --> 01:12:32,840
You want to hear something
I wrote for Hellbender?

657
01:12:33,885 --> 01:12:34,668
Okay.

658
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,499
There was a wolf who
longed to be a sheep.

659
01:12:40,718 --> 01:12:44,112
So, she cut her claws
and cracked her teeth.

660
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:46,332
She buried deep
the wolf beneath.

661
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:51,076
And when she bore a cub,
she raised it as a lamb.

662
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:55,863
She cut its claws and
cracked its teeth.

663
01:12:55,907 --> 01:12:58,170
She buried deep
the wolf beneath.

664
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:02,957
But when the lamb
grew, so did her claws.

665
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,829
So, did her teeth.

666
01:13:04,872 --> 01:13:08,180
And the wolf ate her mother
who was just a sheep.

667
01:13:09,268 --> 01:13:10,704
You like it?

668
01:13:14,534 --> 01:13:16,014
Hey, did you meet
my friend Amber?

669
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:20,366
She's still alive and
she's scared shitless.

670
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:34,336
Cheers.

671
01:13:47,654 --> 01:13:49,047
Please!

672
01:13:56,794 --> 01:13:57,664
Help, help!

673
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:36,241
Help me.

674
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:49,820
Help!

675
01:15:57,349 --> 01:15:58,306
Fuck!

676
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,986
Help, I wanna go home.

677
01:16:29,947 --> 01:16:33,080
Help.

678
01:16:33,124 --> 01:16:35,735
I can't, I can't move.

679
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:36,736
Is she here?

680
01:16:37,955 --> 01:16:38,912
Please help.

681
01:16:40,914 --> 01:16:42,524
I can't move my body.

682
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:46,441
Please help.

683
01:16:46,485 --> 01:16:50,924
Help.

684
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:55,929
Help me, help me,
help, help.

685
01:16:56,582 --> 01:16:57,496
Please help.

686
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,152
Let me out, let me go!

687
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:04,068
Don't let her do this to me.

688
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:08,942
Please don't leave me.

689
01:17:08,986 --> 01:17:10,901
Don't leave me.

690
01:17:10,944 --> 01:17:13,033
Please don't leave me!

691
01:17:13,077 --> 01:17:14,469
Please, help me please.

692
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:23,739
Hey, Mom, that's
my friend Amber.

693
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:27,047
Remember, we met her uncle
in the woods that day.

694
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:28,962
I think you dusted him.

695
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:34,054
Ooh, I like that trick.

696
01:17:34,098 --> 01:17:35,838
It's a great one to do
right in front of people.

697
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:40,060
It just fuckin' paralyzes
them with fear, like Amber.

698
01:17:40,104 --> 01:17:42,280
I saw you take a taste.

699
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:43,455
- No.
- Izzy...

700
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:47,459
What, what have you done, what?

701
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:50,201
What is this place?

702
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:52,203
My happy place.

703
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:55,510
I'm not gonna let
you kill this girl.

704
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:59,819
I'm gonna save her
so I can save you.

705
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:02,256
Save me from what?

706
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:08,088
Izzy, I just wanted to save you

707
01:18:08,132 --> 01:18:10,438
from the hell that I've known.

708
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:13,789
I just wanted us to be...

709
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,356
Please!

710
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,662
People.

711
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:18,185
People?

712
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:20,231
Like the people
you've kept me from?

713
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:22,146
Like Amber?

714
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:26,324
The people that believe
in good and evil?

715
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:28,717
God and the devil?

716
01:18:32,025 --> 01:18:33,984
If they want to believe
in hell so badly,

717
01:18:35,028 --> 01:18:36,116
I'll give 'em hell.

718
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,857
Let me go!

719
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:38,858
Izzy, you're good.

720
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:42,383
I raised you to be good.

721
01:18:44,037 --> 01:18:44,864
Not evil.

722
01:18:47,867 --> 01:18:50,000
I saw the book.

723
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:55,005
The blood, the bodies,
the babies, the terror.

724
01:18:56,528 --> 01:18:59,705
I listened to your secrets
and I watched your dreams.

725
01:19:01,185 --> 01:19:02,273
I know the truth, Mom.

726
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:07,147
I did what I was taught to do.

727
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,757
And you denied me that right.

728
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:11,543
Right.

729
01:19:12,718 --> 01:19:16,635
To be a tool for the
hands of hell.

730
01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:19,638
It's not a gift, Izzy.

731
01:19:20,813 --> 01:19:22,554
Then why was it given?

732
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:26,645
I know the only way
a hellbender can die.

733
01:19:27,907 --> 01:19:30,910
Winter eats fall,
fall eats summer,

734
01:19:32,085 --> 01:19:35,393
summer eats spring,
and spring eats winter.

735
01:19:36,829 --> 01:19:40,398
Did your mother
sacrifice herself or?

736
01:19:41,921 --> 01:19:42,748
I think I know.

737
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,577
Watch out, Mom.

738
01:19:47,231 --> 01:19:49,059
You might turn into
a real hellbender.

739
01:19:50,973 --> 01:19:52,540
I know you're in there.

740
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,064
Show me.

741
01:19:59,243 --> 01:20:00,070
Let me see.

742
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:03,943
There you are.

743
01:20:05,771 --> 01:20:06,772
You're so beautiful.

744
01:20:09,688 --> 01:20:10,471
Thank you.

745
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,996
Now, it's my turn.

746
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,042
I'm not afraid of you, Izzy.

747
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:18,262
You will be.

748
01:20:30,274 --> 01:20:34,408
Help, please help me.

749
01:20:50,903 --> 01:20:53,123
Don't, I'm not ready.

750
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:54,776
I'm not ready.

751
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,864
I'm not ready.

752
01:20:55,908 --> 01:20:57,127
I'm not, don't.

753
01:20:58,824 --> 01:21:01,696
Mom, I'm not gonna eat you.

754
01:21:03,307 --> 01:21:05,309
I'm not ready to have
a little hellbender.

755
01:21:07,485 --> 01:21:08,660
And I love you.

756
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:13,491
I'm going to town,
you need anything?

757
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:17,147
Bass strings.

758
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,017
You got it.
